4) Describe an application which needs syntactic and/or dependency parsing. Explain briefly why. (1/2 pag.)

A. The syntactic parsing of a sentence consists of  finding the correct syntactic structure of that sentence in a given formalism/grammar.

B. -> Dependency Parsing is more straightforward– Parsing can be reduced to labeling each token pair wi and 
wj.
     -> Dependency structure independent of word order – Suitable for free word order languages (like Indian 
languages)

So, syntactic parsing looks at hierarchical structures, while dependency parsing emphasizes relationships between individual words.

An exmaple of an application that utilizes syntactic and dependency parsing is a machine translation system.
Parsing is needed in order to satisfy different conditions:
1. Sentence structure analysis: syntactic parsing allows the system to analyze the grammatical structure of sentences in the source language, 
which is essential for accurately translating them into the target language while maintaining meaning.

2. Understanding word relationships: dependency parsing helps the system to identify relationships between words, enabling it to produce 
more coherent translations. For example distinguishing between subjects, verbs, and objects ensures that the translated sentence reflects the 
correct relationships.

3. Handling ambiguity: languages often have ambiguous phrases. Parsing helps disambiguate meanings based on context, which is vital for 
producing translations that make in the target language.

Another examples where syntactic and dependency parsing are needed are:
I. A chatbot designed for customer support
II. Automated resume screening software
III. Snetiment analysis tools
